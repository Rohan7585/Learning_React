## Operators
#### Operators perform calculations or comparisons on values:

  - Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)
  - Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `===` (strict equality), `!==` (strict inequality), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Logical Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
  - Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` (shorthand assignments)
#### Example:
```JavaScript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let sum = x + y;
let difference = x - y;
let isGreaterThan = x > y;

let isEven = (x % 2) === 0; // Check if a number is even using modulo and strict comparison

let message = "The sum is " + sum;
console.log(message);
```

### Comparison Operators
These operators compare values and return true or false.

  - `==` (Loose Equality): Checks for value equality, allowing type coercion (conversion).
```JS
let num1 = 10;
let string10 = "10";

console.log(num1 == string10); // true (coerces string to number)
```
  -  `!=` (Not Equal): The opposite of `==`.
```JS
let num2 = 5;
let string5 = "5";

console.log(num2 != string5); // false (coerced to same value)
```
  - `===` (Strict Equality): Checks for both value and type equality.
```JS
console.log(num1 === string10); // false (different types)
console.log(num2 !== string5); // true (different types)
```
  - `<` (Less Than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right.
```JS
console.log(num1 < num2); // false
```
  - `>` (Greater Than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.
```JS
console.log(num1 > num2); // true
```
  - `<=` (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.
```JS
console.log(num1 <= num2); // false
```
  - `>=` (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
```JS
console.log(num1 >= num2); // true
```

### Logical Operators
These operators combine boolean expressions.

  - `&&` (AND): Returns `true` only if both operands are `true`.

```JavaScript
let isStudent = true;
let hasPaid = true;

console.log(isStudent && hasPaid); // true
```
  - `||` (OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.

```JavaScript
let isLoggedIn = false;
let isAdmin = true;

console.log(isLoggedIn || isAdmin); // true
```
  - `!` (NOT): Reverses the boolean value of the operand.

```JavaScript
let isNight = false;

console.log(!isNight); // true
```
### Assignment Operators
These operators assign values to variables and can be shorthands for common operations.

  - `=` (Assignment): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.

```JavaScript
let age = 25;
```
  - `+=` (Add and Assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and then assigns the result.

```JavaScript
age += 5; // age becomes 30
```
  - `-=` (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and then assigns the result.

```JavaScript
age -= 2; // age becomes 28
```
  - `*=` (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the right operand by the left operand and then assigns the result.

```JavaScript
age *= 2; // age becomes 56
```
  - `/=` (Divide and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and then assigns the result.

```JavaScript
age /= 7; // age becomes 8 (truncates decimals)
```
  - `%=` (Modulo and Assign): Performs a modulo operation (remainder) and assigns the result.

```JavaScript
let remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder becomes 1
```
