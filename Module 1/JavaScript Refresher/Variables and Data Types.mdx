## Variables and Data Types

Variables store data that can be used throughout your code. JavaScript offers different ways to declare variables:

* **`let`:** Used for variables that can be reassigned later.
* **`const`:** Used for constant values that cannot be changed after initialization. This is generally preferred for immutability.
* **`var` (Discouraged):** Avoid using `var` due to potential scoping issues. Use `let` or `const` instead.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Using `let` for a re-assignable variable
let message = "Hello, world!";
message = "Welcome to React!";

// Using `const` for a constant
const PI = 3.14159;

// Using `var` (not recommended)
var name = "Rohan"; // Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript
```

### Data Types:

 JavaScript has various data types to represent different kinds of information:

#### Primitive Data Types:
  - String: Represents textual data enclosed in quotes (single quotes ', double quotes ").
  - Number: Represents numerical values (integers, decimals).
  - Boolean: Represents Boolean values (true or false).
  - null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
  - undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
#### Complex Data Types:
  - Object: A collection of key-value pairs, storing properties and their values.
  - Array: An ordered list of items of any data type.

```JS
// Primitive data types
let aString = "This is a string";
let aNumber = 42;
let isTrue = true;
let isNull = null;
let isUndefined; // Declared without assignment

// Complex data types
let person = {
  name: "ROHAN",
  age: 23
};  //Objects

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; //Array
```
