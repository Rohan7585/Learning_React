## Control Flow with if Statements
#### Control flow statements dictate the execution path of your code based on conditions:

  - if Statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
  - else if Statement (Optional): Provides alternative execution paths if the initial if condition is false.
  - else Statement (Optional): Executes a block of code if all previous conditions are false.
####Example:

```JavaScript
let grade = 85;

if (grade >= 90) {
  console.log("Excellent!");
} else if (grade >= 80) {
  console.log("Good job!");
} else {
  console.log("Keep practicing!");
}
```
