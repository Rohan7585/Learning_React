# Loop Control Stastements
 Loops are control structures that repeat a block of code multiple times based on a specified condition. They are fundamental for iterating over arrays, processing data, and performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

 Loops in JavaScript are essential for iterating over data structures or executing a block of code repeatedly. There are primarily three types of loops you'll commonly use: for, while, and do...while. Here's how each works:

#### 1. *`for` Loop:*
 The `for` loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to execute the loop.
 ```
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
* **Initialization:** Initializes the loop counter (e.g., `let i = 0;`)
* **Condition:** Defines the condition for executing the loop (e.g., `i < 5;`)
* **Iteration:** Increases or decreases the loop counter after each iteration (e.g., `i++` for incrementing).

* **Example:**
  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  }
  ```

#### 2. *`while` Loop*:
The `while` loop repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
```
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
  * **Condition:** An expression evaluated before each loop iteration. If this condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues.
  * **Example:**
    ```javascript
    let i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
      console.log(i); // prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
      i++;
    }
    ```

#### 3. *`do...while` Loop*:
The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it ensures that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.
```
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
  * **Example:**
    ```javascript
    let i = 0;
    do {
      console.log(i); // prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);
    ```

### Loop Control Statements
JavaScript also supports loop control statements like break and continue:

  * `break` terminates the loop immediately.
  * `continue` skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
  #### **Example:**
  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
      continue; // skip iteration when i is 2
    }
    if (i === 4) {
      break; // terminate the loop when i is 4
    }
    console.log(i); // prints 0, 1, 3
  }
  ```
